# Brute Force
## Low Difficulty
**What is Brute Force?**
> Brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys. It can be automated using password cracking tools such as hydra and John the Ripper that comes with different wordlists and customizable options, making the cracking process faster and easier. In this case, since we already know the credential is ‘admin’ and ‘password’ as they are the one that we used for login, we will pretend that we don’t know the credential and try to brute force it.
