# DVWA Web Application Write-Ups

This repository contains a series of write-ups for [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA), a purposefully insecure web application used to practice and learn various web security vulnerabilities.

These walkthroughs were done in a lab environment using:
- Kali Linux
- Both self-hosted DVWA & DVWA in Metasploitable 2

## üí° Covered Vulnerabilities

Each wrietups contains:
- Step-by-step exploitation
- Tool usage
- Screenshots
- Observations across **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** difficulty levels
- Skills and techniques learned

## üß† Skills Learned

- Exploitation of common web vulnerabilities (e.g., SQLi, XSS, CSRF, File Inclusion) across different difficulty levels with hands-on testing
- Manual and automated testing using Burp Suite, including request manipulation, repeater, intruder, and proxy tools
- Client-side and server-side analysis using browser developer tools and JavaScript debugging to uncover hidden logic or bypasses
- Enumeration and abuse of misconfigured APIs and cryptographic implementations, including IDORs, insecure JWTs, and padding oracles
- Practical understanding of real-world attack chains, from reconnaissance to privilege escalation and persistence
