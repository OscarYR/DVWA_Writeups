# DVWA Web Application Write-Ups

This repository contains a series of write-ups for [DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA), a purposefully insecure web application used to practice and learn various web security vulnerabilities.

These walkthroughs were done in a lab environment using:
- 🖥️ **Attacker**: Kali Linux
- 🧪 **Victim**: DVWA in Metasploitable 2
- 🔧 **Tools**: Burp Suite, Hydra, curl, Firefox Developer Tools

## 💡 Covered Vulnerabilities

Each folder contains:
- Step-by-step exploitation
- Tool usage (Burp Suite, manual, etc.)
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Observations across **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** difficulty levels
- Skills and techniques learned
